# Motivating example

Imagine you're holding a raffle at a meetup. You're going to give away
3 prizes. All of the attendees have been assigned a number, from 1 to 30.

```bash
seq 30 | ...
```

Now shuffle the members (requires GNU [`shuf`][shuf]):

```bash
seq 30 | shuf | ...
```

Select only the first 3:

```bash
seq 30 | shuf | head -3 | ...
```

And now add suspense by using `reveal`!

```bash
seq 30 | shuf | head -3 | reveal
```
